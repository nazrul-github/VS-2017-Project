-----
1. Need a class call stopwatch
2. will simulate a stopwatch
3. we need two methods
4. start and stop
5. Will call the start method first
6. stop method will follow
7. will ask the stopwatch for the duration of time (difference between start method and stop method)
8. duration should be value of time span
9. the stopwatch can get called different time; ---- and every time it get's it will show proper time
10. the stopwatch should not be get called twice before stoping, if it gets called twice it will throw an invalid operation exception.

Must To Do -- Use encapsulation and information hiding so the implementetion details of the class not get's revealed. From the outside
one should not be able to missuse the class;
